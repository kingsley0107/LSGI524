# Assignment2

## Introduction

This is my another personal assignment for **LSGI524** _URBAN AND GEOSPATIAL BIG DATA ANALYTICS_

This Readme gives you a brief introduction to my files structure and understand to corresponding relationship between my codes and the tasks.

Unlike Assignment 1, due to the larger dataset and longer execution time in Assignment 2, a .ipynb code format was submitted. In .ipynb, each line's output can be observed alongside the corresponding execution outcome.

So the file tree in this .zip file is :

    ./
        code_23054061g_JunranLiang/
            assignment2.ipynb
    
        reports_23054061g_JunranLiang/
            23054061g_JunranLiang.pdf

## Method

In this assignment, I analyse a large-scale dataset with more than 1GB, which is inavailable to read it all into memory at once using pandas.read.

So I utilised dask.dataframe, which enpower the capacity of calculation in parallel computing way.

## Reports

Reports are named as '23054061g_assignment2.pdf'

## Others

All the python packages used are written in requirements.txt
